The core implementation of the DateTime.pm and DateTime::Duration
modules come from Date::ICal and Date::ICal::Duration, both written by
Rich Bowen <rbowen@rcbowen.com> with help from the Reefknot team.

Parts of the API come from Time::Piece, by Matt Sergeant
<matt@sergeant.org>, who had help from Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>.
That API was originally created by Larry Wall.

The DateTime::Language functionality is largely based on the
Date::Language modules that come with Graham Barr's <gbarr@pobox.com>
TimeDate modules suite.  The strftime method in this module also
borrow heavily from Graham's implementation.

Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org> jammed all the round pegs in the square
holes until they fit.
