TODO list for Perl module DateTime

- strftime - localizable!

- last day of month

- week number of year

- memo-ization for all the little component methods, with cache
flushed on changes (add, etc.)

- add gmtime and localtime methods, perhaps?

- reasonable stringification.  numification?

- more tests for setting offset via offset() method

- sub-second resolution - at least microseconds (cooperate with
Time::HiRes), but is micro small enough?

- no ordinal suffixes for Czech language.  contact Honza Padziadora?

- wrapping mode bits in _add need to become class/object attribute

- print_error, raise_error, & error_handler options ala DBI.  Default
to Exception::Class throwing.

- Offset should be specified as DateTime::TimeZone object (or
something like that) as well as, or instead of, a string/number.

- Implement DateTime::TimeZone (see
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/reefknot/Date-ICal-Timezone/)

- overloading for DateTime::Duration, addition, subtraction,
multiplication (duration * int), division? (duration / int).

- add warnings about naughtiness of epoch to docs.

- jd/mjd methods?

- document RD days/seconds(/nanosecs?) in a separate document that
will be the reference for DateTime.pm internals, as well as being
useful for other calendar implementors.
