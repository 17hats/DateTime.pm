TODO list for Perl module DateTime

* strftime method

- either remove "preferred format" parts from strftime or add
preferered_{date,time,datetime}_format methods for each language
(which then has the US-en vs. UK-en mess to deal with, plus others no
doubt)

- figure out what %O* and %E* modifiers should do, if anything

- more tests for other languages


* More methods

- last day of month (of week?).  first day of month (week?)

- add gmtime and localtime methods, perhaps?

- jd/mjd methods?


* Optimization

- optimize methods like week and day_of_year


* Other

- sub-second resolution - at least microseconds (cooperate with
Time::HiRes), but is micro small enough?

- overloading for DateTime::Duration, addition, subtraction,
multiplication (duration * int), division? (duration / int).

- document RD days/seconds(/nanosecs?) in a separate document that
will be the reference for DateTime.pm internals, as well as being
useful for other calendar implementors.

- document stringification

- document error handling features

- Time::Local is now a core module, with no CPAN existence.  But the
version that works best is in 5.8.0, and not otherwise available.

- tests for end_of_month_day_of_year (rename?) and month_lengths

- thorough tests for subtraction & addition overloading
