TODO list for Perl module DateTime

* strftime method

- either remove "preferred format" parts from strftime or add
preferered_{date,time,datetime}_format methods for each language
(which then has the US-en vs. UK-en mess to deal with, plus others no
doubt)

- more tests for other languages


* More methods

- last day of month (of week?).  first day of month (week?)

- add gmtime and localtime methods, perhaps?

- jd/mjd methods?


* Other

- sub-second resolution - at least microseconds (cooperate with
Time::HiRes), but is micro small enough?

- overloading for DateTime::Duration: multiplication (duration * int),
division? (duration / int).

- document RD days/seconds(/nanosecs?) in a separate document that
will be the reference for DateTime.pm internals, as well as being
useful for other calendar implementors.

- Time::Local is now a core module, with no CPAN existence.  But the
version that works best is in 5.8.0, and not otherwise available.

- thorough tests for subtraction & addition overloading
